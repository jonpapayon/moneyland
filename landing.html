                <p>Make your godfather offer In order to convert, your offer must be: Clear and easy to understand: There should be no question as to what your audience is getting in return for their email/purchase/registration.</p>
                <p>Value-based: Your offer copy should be focused on how it will fill a need or solve a problem. <br> Concise: Keeping it short and to the point will drive more conversions.  <br> Persuasive: If there ever was a place to bust out your salesperson chops, your offer is it. <br> Irresistible: It must be such a good offer that it's a no-brainer for your prospect and even leaves them asking themselves, 'How can they possibly offer so much
                value?' Make it so compelling that only a lunatic would refuse!</p>

                <p>Add bonuses Add relevant bonuses or sweeteners to the offer. These should be highly desirable but not essential to reaching the desired outcome - prospects simply need to want them.</p>

                <p>Stack the value Use the value stack to do just that… stack up the total value and benefits of everything in your offer. Tell them how much everything is worth then paint a vivid picture with benefit explanations to raise your offer's perceived value.</p>

                <p>Reveal your price Add prices together to calculate value, then reveal a price that's much cheaper. Explain why the price is what it is and why it's such great value. If your goal is lead generation and you're pitching a free consult, it's important that you put a dollar value on what the consult is worth.</p>

                <p>Inject scarcity Offers without scarcity don't sell as well, but it needs to be genuine or you'll destroy your reputation. Think about it: If you don't need to take action now, when will you take it? Never. Examples of scarcity include: Putting an expiration date on your offer Countdown clocks 'Doors are closing' 'Only X left at this price' 'Buy before X to avoid a price hike' Scarcity has been shown time and time again to skyrocket conversion rates.</p>

                <p>Give a powerful guarantee Remove, eliminate, reverse, and take out perceived risks. Longer guarantee = less returns. A guarantee transfers the risk from the buyer to the seller. And it shows the buyer that if the product doesn't deliver, they won't be at a loss of time or money, thus eliminating the pain of buying. Whether it's a no-risk money-back guarantee or a promise to not share their information, guarantees remove the risk associated with your offer.</p>

                <p>Call to action (CTA) The call to action is a command. Be specific and tell them exactly what to do. Keep it clear and direct - your audience shouldn't have to play 21 Questions to figure out what you want them to do. Ask them to do just one thing, because the more hoops you ask them to jump through, the more likely they'll be to say 'screw this' and leave.</p>

Remind them of your irresistible Godfather Offer. Warn them against the consequence of what will happen if they don't buy. Include your call to action and remind them of the limited time or quantity.</p>
